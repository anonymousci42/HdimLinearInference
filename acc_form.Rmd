<!--HOW TO COMPLETE THIS FORM:-->

<!--
1. Checkboxes in this document appear as follows: 

- [ ] This is a checkbox 

To check a checkbox, replace [ ] by [x], as follows: 

- [x] This is a checked checkbox 

Note that older versions of RStudio (versions lower than 1.3) may not create a formatted checkbox but will leave the original characters, i.e., literally "[ ]" or "[x]". It's fine to submit a PDF in this form.
 
2. For text answers, simply type the relevant text in the areas indicated. A blank line starts a new paragraph. 
 
3. Comments (like these instructions) provide additional instructions throughout the form. There is no need to remove them; they will not appear in the compiled document. 

4. If you are comfortable with Markdown syntax, you may choose to include any Markdown-compliant formatting in the form. For example, you may wish to include R code chunks and compile this document in R Markdown.
-->

This form documents the artifacts associated with the article (i.e., the data and code supporting the computational findings) and describes how to reproduce the findings.


# Part 1: Data

- [ ] This paper does not involve analysis of external data (i.e., no data are used or the only data are generated by the authors via simulation in their code).

<!--
If box above is checked and if no simulated/synthetic data files are provided by the authors, please skip directly to the Code section. Otherwise, continue.
-->

- [x] I certify that the author(s) of the manuscript have legitimate access to and permission to use the data used in this manuscript.

<!-- If data are simulated using random number generation, please be sure to set the random number seed in the code you provide -->

## Abstract


The transNOAH breast cancer trial dataset (GSE50948), as described in Prat et al. (2014). This data consists
of gene expression profiling measurements from 156 patients. For our analysis, we use expres sion measurements of the gene probe 204531 s at, associated with BRCA1, as the response
variable Y .

## Availability


- [x] Data **are** publicly available.
- [ ] Data **cannot be made** publicly available.

If the data are publicly available, see the *Publicly available data* section. Otherwise, see the *Non-publicly available data* section, below.

### Publicly available data

- [ ] Data are available online at:

- [x] Data are available as part of the paper’s supplementary material.

- [ ] Data are publicly available by request, following the process described here:

- [ ] Data are or will be made available through some other mechanism, described here:


<!-- If data are available by request to the authors or some other data owner, please make sure to explain the process of requesting access to the data. -->

### Non-publicly available data

<!--
The Journal of the American Statistical Association requires authors to make data accompanying their papers available to the scientific community except in cases where: 1) public sharing of data would be impossible, 2) suitable synthetic data are provided which allow the main analyses to be replicated (recognizing that results may differ from the "real" data analyses), and 3) the scientific value of the results and methods outweigh the lack of reproducibility.

Please discuss the lack of publicly available data. For example:
-	why data sharing is not possible,
-	what synthetic data are provided, and 
-	why the value of the paper's scientific contribution outweighs the lack of reproducibility.

### Additional information (optional)

<!--
OPTIONAL: By default, submitted code will be published on the JASA GitHub repository (http://github.com/JASA-ACS) as well as in the supplementary material. Authors are encouraged to also make their code available in a public code repository, such as on GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket.

-->

## Scope

The provided workflow reproduces:

- [x] Any numbers provided in text in the paper
- [x] The computational method(s) presented in the paper (i.e., code is provided that implements the method(s))
- [x] All tables and figures in the paper
- [ ] Selected tables and figures in the paper, as explained and justified below:

## Workflow

### Location

The workflow is available:

<!--
Check all that apply, and in the case of a Git repository include unique identifier, such as specific commit ID, branch, release, or tag.
-->
- [x] As part of the paper’s supplementary material.
- [x] In this Git repository: https://github.com/anonymousci42/HdimLinearInference
- [ ] Other (please specify):

<!--

We strongly encourage authors to place their materials (but not large datasets) in a Git repository hosted on a site such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. If the repository is private during the review process, please indicate the location where it will be available publicly upon publication, and also include the materials as a zip file (e.g., obtained directly from the Git hosting site) as supplementary materials.
-->


### Format(s)

<!--
Check all that apply
-->
- [x] Single master code file 
- [ ] Wrapper (shell) script(s)
- [ ] Self-contained R Markdown file, Jupyter notebook, or other literate programming approach
- [x] Text file (e.g., a readme-style file) that documents workflow

- [ ] Other (more detail in *Instructions* below)

### Instructions
Step 1: load the required R packages.

Step 2: Run the "NPE1.R" script to generate the results of the proposed method without power enhancement term JPE. We only provide a script with fixed parameters, the whole tasks cannot be done in a single local computer.

Step 3: Run the "PPE1.R" and ``SIHR.R" to generate the results of two comparative methods.

Step 4: Run the "PE1.R" in the folder PE_FULL, to reproduce the results of the proposed method with power enhancement term JPE. 

Step 5: Run the "Data_Analysis.R" to summarize all the output into different tables.

Step 6: Run the "Real_Data_Analysis.R" in the folder "Real Data Analysis" to reproduce the result of the transNOAH data.

Implementation details and illustration of outputs are provided in the README.md.
<!--
Describe how to use the materials provided to reproduce analyses in the manuscript. Additional details can be provided in file(s) accompanying the reproducibility materials. If no workflow is provided, please state this and say why (e.g., if the paper contains no computational work).
-->

### Expected run-time

Approximate time needed to reproduce the analyses on a standard desktop machine:

- [ ] < 1 minute
- [ ] 1-10 minutes
- [ ] 10-60 minutes
- [ ] 1-8 hours
- [ ] > 8 hours
- [x] Not feasible to run on a desktop machine, as described here:

### Additional information (optional)

-->

# Notes (optional)
